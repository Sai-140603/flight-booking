This project is a responsive flight booking web page designed using HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS.
The page displays a list of flights in a card-based layout that automatically adjusts to different screen sizes like desktop, tablet, and mobile. It aims to provide a simple, attractive, and user-friendly booking interface.

Features:

Uses Bootstrap’s grid system for responsive layout.
Displays flight information such as airline logo, route, price, and timing.
Each card includes a “Book Now” button.
Automatically adjusts layout for all devices
Includes Font Awesome icons for better visuals.
Uses custom CSS for additional styling, padding, and hover effects.

Technologies Used:

HTML for page structure.
Bootstrap for responsive design and layout.
CSS for styling and customization.
Font Awesome for icons.

How It Works:

The web page uses Bootstrap’s grid system to arrange flight cards.
When viewed on smaller screens, the number of cards per row decreases automatically using Bootstrap’s responsive classes and media queries.
Each flight card shows important details like flight name, logo, route, price, and a “Book Now” button for user interaction.

How to Run the Project:

Download or clone the project folder.
Open the HTML file  in any web browser.
Ensure that your internet connection is active to load Bootstrap and Font Awesome from the CDN links.

Optional Enhancements:

Add a search bar to filter flights by route or airline.
Add hover animations to buttons or cards.
Include a footer with contact details or copyright information.

Project Goal:
To build a clean, simple, and responsive flight booking interface that provides a good user experience across all devices.
